                     If the customer wishes to trade in a vehicle, Finquote will organise provisionally a value for the trade in vehicle based on the customer’s description of it.Valuations will be valid for the time stated in the trade documents in this order, after which the trade in vehicle may need to be re-valued.As the customer is permitted to use the vehicle between initial valuation and delivery of new car, the customer is responsible for the following whilst the trade-in is in their possession; proper care and maintenance (including but not exclusive to the following: servicing, tyres, and mechanical repairs), registration renewals, loss or damage to the vehicle, insurance claims, and depreciation. Any kilometres travelled above the odometer cap provided with this order will be charged at 35c/kilometre, further depreciation may also be charged beyond the valid valuation period. </p>
                     
                     <p>
                     Before taking delivery of the motor vehicle, the Customer shall deliver to the Dealer the trade-in vehicle together with all accessories, extras and attachments fitted at the time of valuation. If the trade-in vehicle is not in substantially the same condition as when valued by the Dealer or wholesale agent organised by Finquote, the parties may negotiate a variation in the net trade-in allowance or either party may rescind the trade-in inclusion upon which a revised new vehicle order will be raised.</p>
                     
                     <p> 
                     If the Customer is entitled and duly elects to terminate this contract under the Cooling Off Rights the Customer is liable to the dealer for any damage to the motor vehicle while it was in the Customer’s possession, other than fair wear and tear; the Dealer need not return any trade in vehicle if the dealer is unable to return it because of a defect in the trade in vehicle, not caused by the Dealer, that renders the trade in vehicle incapable of being driven or unroadworthy, but the Dealer must permit, and the Customer must arrange for, the collection of the trade in vehicle from the Dealer within 24 hours of exercise of the Cooling Off Right;</p>
                     
                     <p>
                     The Customer shall be deemed not to have paid for the new vehicle until unencumbered title for the trade is passed to the buyer of the trade in.

                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If the customer fails to pay the difference to Finquote when demanded, at the discretion of Finquote options include:</p>
