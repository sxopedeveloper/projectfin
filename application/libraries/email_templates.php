				New Car dealerships all want to retain clients from their PMA and not lose them to other same brand dealers or competing ones. <b>With PMA Protection we return any inquiry to your dealership instead of tendering the clients to multiple dealers.</b>
			</p>
			<p style="line-height: 1.5">
				The retail inquiry we have in your area is currently tendered and won by the cheapest dealer. You will no doubt receive a <b>“pump in”</b> or <b>“out of area order”</b> report for the area you are protecting and you would know the significance of even a few deals that are lost.
			</p>
			<p style="line-height: 1.5">
				You can now elect to <b>purchase leads immediately</b> upon their arrival as inquiry at Car Quotes Online and prior to tender. These leads will be notified that you are the dealer that is the cheapest dealer for the make and model that they inquired on and that you will contact them within 24 hours.
			</p>
			<p style="line-height: 1.5">
				The PMA protection only applies to the first 10 in your area every month. You can elect to buy all however you will need to do so manually using the lead map on <a href="http://dealers.carquote.net.au" target="_blank"><b>www.dealers.carquote.net.au</b></a>
